# Copilot.vim

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer which suggests line completions and
entire function bodies as you type. GitHub Copilot is powered by the OpenAI
Codex AI system, trained on public Internet text and billions of lines of
code.

Copilot.vim is a Vim plugin for GitHub Copilot.  For now, it requires a Neovim
0.6 prerelease and a Node.js installation.

## Technical Preview

Access to GitHub Copilot is limited to a small group of testers during the
technical preview of GitHub Copilot. If you don’t have access to the technical
preview, you will see an error when you try to use this extension.

Don’t have access yet? [Sign up for the
waitlist](https://github.com/features/copilot/signup) for your chance to try
it out. GitHub will notify you once you have access.

This technical preview is a Beta Preview under the [GitHub Terms of
Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#j-beta-previews).

## Getting started

1.  Install [Node.js][] v12 or newer.

2.  Install a [Neovim prerelease build][].  (Note: On macOS, [extra steps][]
    are required to due to lack of notarization. Alternatively, Homebrew users
    can run `brew install neovim --HEAD`).

3.  Install `github/copilot.vim` using vim-plug, packer.nvim, or any other
    plugin manager.  Or to install directly:

        git clone https://github.com/github/copilot.vim.git \
          ~/.config/nvim/pack/github/start/copilot.vim

4.  Start Neovim and invoke `:Copilot setup`.

## Customization

If you would like to change the color of the suggestion text from Copilot
add a line like the following to your `.vimrc` / `nvim/init.vim`:

```
hi def CopilotSuggestion guifg=#808080 ctermfg=244
```

The above are the default values for the GUI and terminal. You might want a 
[cheat sheet for 256 colors](https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/) for the
terminal.
